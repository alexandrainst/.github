The **[Alexandra Institute](https://alexandra.dk/about-the-alexandra-institute/)** is a Danish non-profit company that works with research-based IT innovation. We collaborate with public and private organisations to develop state-of-the-art IT solutions that are effective and secure and offer innovative user experiences. We have around 100 employees with different backgrounds, including computer scientists, architects, anthropologists, engineers, designers, business developers, etc.

The Alexandra Institute was established in Aarhus (Denmark) in 1999 by business people, researchers and representatives from public authorities who wanted to stimulate growth in Danish companies through university-industry collaboration on IT. In 2007, the Alexandra Institute was approved as a [*technological service provider* (GTS institute)](https://gts-net.dk/english/) by the Danish Minister of Higher Education and Science. In 2012, the Alexandra Institute was acquired by Aarhus University Research Foundation.

Our Aarhus office is located in the IT City of Katrinebjerg in the same building as the [Department of Computer Science at Aarhus University](https://cs.au.dk/). Our Copenhagen offices are located at the [IT University of Copenhagen](http://en.itu.dk/).
