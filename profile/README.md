The Alexandra Institute was established in Aarhus (Denmark) in 1999 by business people, researchers and representatives from public authorities who wanted to stimulate growth in Danish companies through university-industry collaboration on IT. In 2007, the Alexandra Institute was approved as a [*technological service provider* (GTS institute)](https://gts-net.dk/english/) by the Danish Minister of Higher Education and Science. In 2012, the Alexandra Institute was acquired by Aarhus University Research Foundation.
